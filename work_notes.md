Building a real deployed full-stack application, backed by Data Science

My Twitoff GitHub repo for this week: https://github.com/chrishuskey/TwitOff

## Day 1: Web Application Development with Flask:

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Chris: Everything went reasonably well and pretty smoothly today. Watching Aleks's DS9 lecture in addition to the DS10 lecture made the Flask setup much more clear.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Chris: Using Flask to set up a very simple "Hello, World" (Hello, Twitoff!) web app was fun. Exciting that we can deploy simple apps on the web using Flask, without spending a week or more learning something more involved like Django.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Chris: No major challenges today -- just needed to watch Aleks's DS9 lecture as a supplement before I understood everything.
